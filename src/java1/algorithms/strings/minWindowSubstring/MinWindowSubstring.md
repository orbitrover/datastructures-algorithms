**Algorithmic Steps**
This problem is solved with the help of sliding window approach using two hash maps. The algorithmic approach can be summarized as follows:

1. Add a preliminary corner case condition by checking the second substring is empty or not. If it is empty, then return the empty substring as minimum window substring.

2. Initialize two HashMaps, which store unique characters and their respective character count for the given two substrings.

3. Initialize minLength variable to max integer value, to store the length of the minimum window substring.

4. Initialize left(leftIndex) and right(rightIndex) indexes to -1, to keep track of the minimum substring window boundaries.

5. Iterate over the second substring and count the character count using hashmap. 

6. Initialize total character count(i.e, `required`) from second substring to max integer value and total character count(i.e, `having`) of first substring based on first substring to 0. 

7. Initialize both left and right pointers to 0, to keep track of the current window substring. 

8. Iterate through second substring using right pointer until the end of string.

9. If the current character from first substring exists in second substring hashmap, update the character counter of first hashmap. Also, increment `having` variable if the character count in both hashmaps are equal.

10. Until `required` and `having` variables are equal, first calculate the left and right indexes along with `minLength` variable. Thereafter, move/increment the left pointer and decrement the character count in first hashmap to find the minimum possible substring window. If the current left character found in second hashmap and first hashmap character count is less than second one, `having` variable needs to be decremented.

11. Repeat steps 9-10 until the end of the first string.

7. If the leftIndex and rightIndex are still equals to -1, return empty string. Otherwise the substring based on leftIdex and rightIndex should be returned from first string.


**Time and Space complexity:**
This algorithm has a time complexity of `O(m) + O(n)`, where m and n represents lenghts of first and second strings. This is because we are traversing both the strings. Also, it requires space complexity of `O(m) + O(n)` due to two hashmaps used to store character count.
