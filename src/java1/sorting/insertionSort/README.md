# Insertion Sort

Insertion sort is the sorting mechanism where the sorted array is built one item at a time. The array elements are compared with each other sequentially and then arranged simultaneously in some particular order.  It works similarly as we sort cards in our hand in a card game.

| Best            | Average             | Worst               | Space (Memory)    | Stable    | Advantage  |
| :-------------: | :-----------------: | :-----------------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------- |
|  O(n)                | O(n<sup>2</sup>)       | O(n<sup>2</sup>)       |  O(1)         | Yes       |   Efficient for data sets that are almost sorted list        |
